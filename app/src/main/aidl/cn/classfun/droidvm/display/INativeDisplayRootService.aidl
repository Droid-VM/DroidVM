 * TCP/JSON-RPC channel. No separate root process is involved: an untrusted_app can neither look up
 * crosvm's display service nor connectto the daemon's su-domain input sockets itself, so it calls
 * these methods on the daemon over binder instead.

     * (multi-touch, tablet) have one device per screen, because their coordinates only mean
     * anything under one output's geometry, so the screen is what picks the device; the keyboard
     * and the relative pointer are VM-wide and ignore it. A screen whose absolute input is
     * switched off has no such device, and this returns false rather than sending the events to
     * some other screen.
